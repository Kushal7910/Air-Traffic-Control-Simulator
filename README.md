# Air-Traffic-Control-Simulator
Air traffic control (ATC) is a service provided by ground-based air traffic controllers who direct aircraft on the ground and through a given section of controlled airspace, and can provide advisory services to aircraft in non-controlled airspace. The primary purpose of ATC worldwide is to prevent collisions, organize and expedite the flow of air traffic, and provide information and other support for pilots.
Air traffic controllers monitor the location of aircraft in their assigned airspace by radar and communicate with the pilots by radio. To prevent collisions, ATC enforces traffic separation rules, which ensure each aircraft maintains a minimum amount of empty space around it at all times. It is also common for ATC to provide services to all private, military, and commercial aircraft operating within its airspace, not just civilian aircraft. Depending on the type of flight and the class of airspace, ATC may issue instructions that pilots are required to obey, or advisories (known as flight information in some countries) that pilots may, at their discretion, disregard. The pilot in command is the final authority for the safe operation of the aircraft and may, in an emergency, deviate from ATC instructions to the extent required to maintain safe operation of their aircraft.
# Priority Scheduling and its importance in Air-Traffic-Control-Simulator
Priority scheduling in an air traffic control system is a critical component of managing and ensuring the safety of aircraft operations. This scheduling technique helps air traffic controllers make real-time decisions to prioritize and manage the flow of aircraft in the airspace and on the ground based on various factors. Here are some key aspects of how priority scheduling is used in air traffic control systems:

Safety: Safety is the foremost concern in air traffic control. Priority scheduling is used to give precedence to emergency situations, such as medical diversions, aircraft with technical issues, or in-flight emergencies. These flights are given the highest priority to ensure they receive immediate attention and assistance.

Separation Requirements: Priority scheduling is used to maintain the required separation between aircraft. Air traffic controllers must ensure that aircraft maintain a safe distance from each other both vertically and horizontally. Priority is given to aircraft to ensure they can maintain these safe separations.

Landing and Takeoff Sequencing: Air traffic controllers use priority scheduling to sequence aircraft for landing and takeoff. Priority is given to aircraft based on their arrival or departure times, airport capacity, and runway availability. The goal is to optimize the flow of traffic to minimize delays and congestion.

Airspace Management: In busy airspace, priority scheduling helps manage the flow of aircraft by assigning specific altitudes and routes. Aircraft with priority may be assigned more direct routes or altitude changes to expedite their journeys.

Weather and Congestion: Aircraft affected by adverse weather conditions or congestion at an airport may be given priority for rerouting or expedited handling. This helps to minimize the impact of weather-related delays on the entire airspace system
